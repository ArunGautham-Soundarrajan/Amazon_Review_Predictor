# Amazon_Review_Predictor
Okay, we all had ideas of selling a product with this specification could have been better. Or the price of the product should have been little cheaper for the specs they provide. I also wanted to know, which specs for the which price, will give maximum ratings for the product. So, I decided to scrap as many laptop details as I could from Amazon and do an Exploratory Data Analysis. At the end I wanted to create a Machine learning model, which could predict the rating for specs which we provide. So we can know, which is the best specs for the price.
